```

## Notes

-   The application uses the `ppadb` library to interact with your Android device.
-   The application uses the `adb` command to send SMS messages.
-   The application creates a folder for each campaign and stores the campaign data in a JSON file.
-   The application does not support scheduling messages for a specific time.
-   To find the X and Y coordinates for the send button, you can use the "Developer options" on your Android device. Enable "Pointer location" under "Input" to see the coordinates when you tap the screen.
